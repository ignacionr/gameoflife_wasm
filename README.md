# Game of Life

Welcome to the Game of Life! This project serves as an example of what you can learn to do with C++. 

## About

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game is played on a grid of cells, where each cell can be either alive or dead. The cells evolve based on a set of rules, creating fascinating patterns and behaviors.
